    'OPRAH'
    
    
8. Make an English-to-French dictionary called e2f and print it. Here are your starter words: dog is chien, cat is chat, and walrus is morse.

10. Make a French-to-English dictionary called f2e from e2f. Use the items method.

    f2e = dict((key,value) for value,key in e2f.items())
    f2e
    {'chat': 'cat', 'chien': 'dog', 'morse': 'walrus'}
    

11. Print the English version of the French word chien using f2e.
Ans:-
    f2e['chien']
    'dog'
    
    
12. Make and print a set of English words from the keys in e2f.
Ans:-
    e2f.keys()
    dict_keys(['dog', 'cat', 'walrus'])


13. Make a multilevel dictionary called life. Use these strings for the topmost keys: 'animals', 'plants', and 'other'. Make the 'animals' key refer to another dictionary with the keys 'cats', 'octopi', and 'emus'. Make the 'cats' key refer to a list of strings with the values 'Henri', 'Grumpy', and 'Lucy'. Make all the other keys refer to empty dictionaries.
Ans:-
    life ={'animals':{'cat':['Henri', 'Grumpy', 'Lucy'], 'octopi':'', 'emus':''},
       'plants' :'',

     'other': '',
     'plants': ''}
     

14. Print the top-level keys of life.
Ans:-
    life.keys()
    dict_keys(['animals', 'plants', 'other'])
    
    
15. Print the keys for life['animals'].
Ans:-
    life['animals'].keys()
    dict_keys(['cat', 'octopi', 'emus'])


16. Print the values for life['animals']['cats']
Ans:-
    life['animals']['cat']
