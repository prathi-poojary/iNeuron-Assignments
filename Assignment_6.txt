1. What are escape characters, and how do you use them?
Ans:-
    To insert characters that are illegal in a string, use an escape character.
    An escape character is a backslash \ followed by the character you want to insert.
    
    Example
    txt = "We are the so-called \"Vikings\" from the north."
    print(txt)
    output-> We are the so-called "Vikings" from the north.
    
    
2. What do the escape characters n and t stand for?
Ans:-
     the backslash "\" is a special character, also called the "escape" character. It is used in representing certain whitespace characters: "\t" is a tab, "\n" is a newline.


3. What is the way to include backslash characters in a string?
Ans:-
    Use the syntax "\\" within the string literal to represent a single backslash.
    
    example
    text = "\\"
    print(text)
    output-> \
    
    
4. The string "Howl's Moving Castle" is a correct value. Why isn't the single quote character in the word Howl's not escaped a problem?
Ans:-
    The single quote in Howl's is fine because you've used double quotes to mark the beginning and end of the string.
    

5. How do you write a string of newlines if you don't want to use the n character?
Ans:-
    Multiline strings allow you to use newlines in strings without the \n escape character.
