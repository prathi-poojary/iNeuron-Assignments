1.How many seconds are in an hour? Use the interactive interpreter as a calculator and multiply the number of seconds in a minute (60) by the number of minutes in an hour (also 60).
sol. 60 
Ans:-
    60 * 60
    3600


2. Assign the result from the previous task (seconds in an hour) to a variable called seconds_per_hour.
Ans:-
    seconds_per_hour = 60 * 60
    seconds_per_hour
    3600


3. How many seconds do you think there are in a day? Make use of the variables seconds per hour and minutes per hour.
Ans:-
    seconds_per_hour*24
    86400
    

4. Calculate seconds per day again, but this time save the result in a variable called seconds_per_day
Ans:-
    seconds_per_hour=seconds_per_hour*24
    seconds_per_hour
    86400
    
    
5. Divide seconds_per_day by seconds_per_hour. Use floating-point (/) division.
Ans:-
    seconds_per_hour/seconds_per_hour
    24.0
    
    
6. Divide seconds_per_day by seconds_per_hour, using integer (//) division. Did this number agree with the floating-point value from the previous question, aside from the final .0?
Ans:-
    seconds_per_hour//seconds_per_hour
    24
    

7. Write a generator, genPrimes, that returns the sequence of prime numbers on successive calls to its next() method: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...
Ans:-
    def genPrimes():
    primes = []
    n = 2
    last = n

    while True:
        for i in primes:
            if n % i == 0:
                n += 1
                break

        else:
            primes.append(n)
            last = n
            n += 1
            yield last
