1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
Ans:-
    The boolean value can be of two types only i.e. either True or False.
    Generally, it is used to represent the truth values of the expressions.
    
    For example,
    1== 1 is True whereas 2<1 is False. 
    
    
    
2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
Ans:-
     The three basic boolean operators are: AND, OR, and NOT.
     
     

3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
Ans:-
    AND               OR                  NOT
        
   1   1    1      1    1    1          1   1   0
   1   0    0      1    0    1          1   0   0
   0   1    0      0    1    1          0   1   1
   0   0    0      0    0    0          0   0   1




4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)
not (5 > 4)
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
(True and True) and (True == False)
(not False) or (not True)

Ans:-
    (5 > 4) and (3 == 5)
    output->False
    
    not (5 > 4)
    output->False
    
    (5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
    output->True
    
    not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
    output->False
    
    (True and True) and (True == False)
    output->False
    
    (not False) or (not True)
    output->True




5. What are the six comparison operators?
Ans:-
    Less than (<)
    Greater than (>)
    Less than or equal to (<=)
    Greater than or equal to (>=)
    Equal to (==)
    Not equal to (!=)
    
    

6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one.
Ans:-
    = operator

    The “=” is an assignment operator is used to assign the value on the right to the variable on the left.

    For example:
        a = 10
        b = 20
        ch = 'y'
        
        

    == operator

    The ‘==’ operator checks whether the two given operands are equal or not. If so, it returns true. Otherwise it returns false.

    For example:
        5==5
        This will return true.



7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
print('bacon')
else:
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')
Ans:-
    The three blocks are everything inside the if statement and the lines print('bacon') and print('ham').
    print('eggs')
    if spam > 5:
        print('bacon')
    else:
        print('ham')
    print('spam')




8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
Ans:-
    if spam == 1:
        print('Hello')
    elif spam == 2:
        print('Howdy')
    else:
        print('Greetings!')




9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys you’ll press?
Ans:-
    An infinite loop is a loop that runs indefinitely and it only stops with external intervention or when a break statement is found. You can stop an infinite loop with CTRL + C




10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
Ans:-
                                break                                                                   continue
        It eliminates the execution of remaining iteration of loop                 It will terminate only the current iteration of loop
        
        
        ‘break’ will resume control of program to the end of                      The ‘continue’ will resume the control of the program to next                                                                                         iteration of that loop enclosing ‘continue'
        loop enclosing that ‘break’.
        
        
        

11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
Ans:-
    start: Starting number of the sequence.
    stop: Generate numbers up to, but not including this number.
    step: Difference between each number in the sequence.

    There are three ways you can call range() :
    
    range(stop) takes one argument. 
    range(10)
    
    range(start, stop) takes two arguments.
    range(0, 10)
     
    range(start, stop, step) takes three arguments.
    range(0, 10, 1)
    
    
    
    
12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
Ans:-
for loop
    for i in range (1,11):
        print(i)

while loop
    i = 1
    while i <= 10:
        print(i)
        i = i + 1
        
        
        

13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
Ans:-
    This function can be called with spam.bacon().
