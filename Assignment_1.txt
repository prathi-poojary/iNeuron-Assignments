+
6 

Ans:-
* - expression
'hello' -  value
-87.8 -  value

2. What is the difference between string and variable?
Ans:-
    A variable is basically the name of the location in the primary memory of your computer. This can be chosen by you. A variable can store everything from strings to numbers.

A string is the values inside the quotes assigned to a string.

A variable can hold a string, but a string can't hold a variable


3. Describe three different data types.
Ans:-
    Data Type                 Used for                      Example
    String                  Alphanumeric characters        hello world, Alice, Bob123
    Integer                 Whole numbers                  7, 12, 999
    Float (floating point)  Number with a decimal point    3.15, 9.06, 00.13
    
    
4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?
Ans:-
    An expression is a combination of operators and operands that is interpreted to produce some other value. In any programming language, an expression is evaluated as per the precedence of its operators.
    So that if there is more than one operator in an expression, their precedence decides which operation will be performed first. 
    
5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?
Ans:-
    An Expression is a sequence or combination of values, variables, operators and function calls that always produces or returns a result value.
     A Statement is the smallest executable unit of code that has an effect, like creating a variable or displaying a value.
     
6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
bacon = 22
bacon + 1
Ans:-
    bacon = 22
    bacon + 1
     output->   23

7. What should the values of the following two terms be?
'spam' + 'spamspam'
'spam' * 3
Ans:-
     'spam' + 'spamspam'
      output-> 'spamspamspam'
     
     'spam' * 3
      output-> 'spamspamspam'  
      
8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?
Ans:-
    because we can't give a variable name as an integer. if we, we should begin with a string-like alphabet name then integer. e100 or eggs100 is valid
    
9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?
Ans:-
    str(), int(), float()
    
10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'
Ans:-
     because 99 is an integer it cannot be concatenated with strings, if we have to concatenate it we need to do typecasting.
