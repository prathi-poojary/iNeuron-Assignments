1. Can you think of a few applications for a sequence-to-sequence RNN? What about a sequence-to-vector RNN? And a vector-to-sequence RNN?
 
2. Why do people use encoderâ€“decoder RNNs rather than plain sequence-to-sequence RNNs for automatic translation?
 
3. How could you combine a convolutional neural network with an RNN to classify videos?
 
4. What are the advantages of building an RNN using dynamic_rnn() rather than static_rnn()?
 
5. How can you deal with variable-length input sequences? What about variable-length output sequences?
 
6. What is a common way to distribute training and execution of a deep RNN across multiple GPUs?
